## Overview

This repository investigates the calibration consistency of Milone eTape sensors used in the **Low-Cost IoT Water Sampler (LCS)** developed by the CSU Agricultural Water Quality Program. Currently, each sensor is individually calibrated to convert its raw resistive output to water depth. However, preliminary observations suggest that for each sensor type (e.g., 8", 12", 15"), the calibration curves (slope and intercept) may be sufficiently similar to justify a unified model. This project uses **Bayesian linear regression** to quantify variability in these calibrations and assess whether type-level models could replace unit-specific calibration.

The goal is to reduce calibration burden while maintaining measurement accuracy—especially important for scale-up in field deployments.

## Methodology
Starting in 2023, the CSU Agricultural Water Quality Program has been calibrating eTape sensors using a standardized protocol. The calibration involves measuring the resistance of the sensor at known water depths (i.e., from 1 inch to the max depth of the individual eTape), which are manually recorded, then regressed to derive a linear relationship between resistance and water depth for each eTape sensor.

This project will utilize a generalized linear model (GLM) framework to analyze the calibration data. The model will include:
- **Response Variable**: Water depth (in inches)
- **Predictor Variable**: Sensor resistivity (in ohms)
- **Group Variable**: eTape model (to account for differing response characteristics across sensor types)

### Statistical Approach

#### Generalized Linear Model

We use a **Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM)** to relate water depth (`water_depth_inch`) to the measured resistance (`resistivity_ohm`) from Milone eTape sensors. The slope, intercept, and residual variance are allowed to vary by `etape_length` (e.g., 8", 12", 15"), which corresponds to the model of the sensor used.

---


```
depth_i ~ Normal(mu_i, sigma_L)

mu_i = alpha_L + beta_L * resistivity_i
```

Where:

- `depth_i` is the known water depth (in inches) for observation `i`
- `resistivity_i` is the resistance (in ohms) from the eTape sensor
- `alpha_L` is the intercept for eTape length group `L`
- `beta_L` is the slope for group `L`
- `sigma_L` is the residual standard deviation for group `L`

---

**Priors:**
Priors are set based on prior knowledge of eTape sensor behavior and individual sensor calibration data. The slope and intercept values are centered around typical values observed in previous calibrations:

| Sensor Length (`etape_length`) | Typical Intercept (`alpha_L`) | Typical Slope (`beta_L`) |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 08 inch                        | \~28                          | -0.017                  |
| 12 inch                        | \~32                          | -0.017                  |
| 15 inch                        | \~40                          | -0.017                  |
| 18 inch                        | \~48                          | -0.017                  |
| 12 inch                        | \~61                          | -0.017                  |

```
alpha_L ~ Normal(aPrior, 5)         # Centered around typical intercepts
beta_L  ~ Normal(-0.0017, 0.0005)  # Reflecting observed slope
sigma_L ~ Exponential(1)
```

Where:
```
aPrior <- c(28, 32, 40, 48, 61)  # Typical intercepts for each sensor length
```

## Data Description
The data for this analysis are stored in `data/etape_data.csv`. It contains calibration data for multiple eTape sensors, including their resistive outputs and corresponding water manually measured water depths. 

The file `data/etape_data.csv` contains raw calibration data for multiple eTape sensors. Each row corresponds to a depth measurement with the associated sensor reading.

## Milone eTape Sensor Details

As documented in the official datasheet (`docs/Standard eTape Manual.pdf`), the eTape sensor:

- Is a solid-state resistive fluid level sensor
- Outputs **resistance inversely proportional to fluid level**
- Has a resolution < 0.01" (0.25 mm)
- Typical output range:
  - 8" sensor: 400–1500 Ω ±20%
  - 12" sensor: 400–2000 Ω ±20%
  - 15" sensor: ~400–2500 Ω (field-observed)
  - Resistance gradient: ~150 Ω/inch or 59.06 Ω/cm

For best results, the sensor must be kept vertically straight and immersed evenly, as outlined in the datasheet.
